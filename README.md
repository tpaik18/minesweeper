WIP code to automatically solve Minesweeper (Google version) using Selenium for
browser interaction and Pillow for image processing. Currently has been tested on
Medium level only and on my MacBook Pro can solve medium in 35-40 seconds on good run.

Dependencies

pip install selenium
pip install webdriver-manager
